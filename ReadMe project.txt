This the project that i had done a work which is changeover the batteries and use the power to run the motor or anything, In detail, the project is about the EV(four-wheeler) emergency backup system When the main battery reached a certain percent then the secondary battery get swapped and the main gets charge in solar and vice versa when the main battery is in use then the secondary battery get charging . By this we are able to reach the nearby power station.And here backup battery(secondary) capacity and weight is half in the main battery.We acheived this demo by using Arduino UNO ,Nodemcu ESP82266,relay's,LM2596,Solar charging controller,solar panel and at last to show the working motor is used.Here we use Lead-Acid batteries and Li-Ion is to be updated soon.
